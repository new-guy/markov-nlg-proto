meet me at market square
let me know if that will work for you
we don't want the game to last too long
we'll have some drinks
I'm back in Durham tomorrow
I will come up and visit
I have a sick blow up bed
we can sit together
no girls around
it will start slowly
no girls allowed
I hope people remember this
I sure as shit will remember this
this has nothing to do with politics
It's pretty fantastic
It does give you powerful tools
the tutorial doesn't seem that bad
explain why all of these things are on the screen
visit when it is time to visit
this phrase was made by a human
this phrase was not made by a human
hopefully people will read this

it is dangerous to wear blue
it can be scary outside at night
it is starting to get a bit dark

I am not sure how many phrases will be needed
We can try using thirty five
Although I am not sure how much these will line up

I'm so pumped right now
Why would you let your dog watch that
you get called Joe sometimes
this sentence is a lie
there are fifty five snails on the wall
not to be sold separately
that shirt looks great on you
give me the laptop
would you like any chocolate
what are you gonna do
that was probably the right choice
